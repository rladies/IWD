Today is International Womenâ€™s Day! 
Itâ€™s an important day for us (although the R-Ladies mission is not limited to women).
ðŸ’œWho are we? R-Ladies is a worldwide organization whose mission is to promote gender diversity in the R community.
ðŸ’œWhy do we exist? The R community suffers from an under-representation of women minority genders in every role and area of participation.
For the rest of day, weâ€™ll be highlighting ways that you can get involved with R-Ladies and be a better ally!
